<dt class='head--doc'>Description</dt>
<dd class='body--doc'><p>In brief, if you call <code class='expr'>Pike.count_memory(0,x)</code> you get back
 the number of bytes <code class='expr'>x</code> occupies in memory.</p>
<p> The detailed story is a bit longer:</p>
<p> This function calculates the number of bytes that all <code class='reference paramref'>things</code>
 occupy. Or put another way, it calculates the number of bytes that
 would be freed if all those things would lose their references at
 the same time, i.e. not only the memory in the things themselves,
 but also in all the things that are directly and indirectly
 referenced from those things and not from anywhere else.</p>
<p> The memory counted is only that which is directly occupied by the
 things in question, including any overallocation for mappings,
 multisets and arrays. Other memory overhead that they give rise to
 is not counted. This means that if you would count the memory
 occupied by all the pike accessible things you would get a figure
 significantly lower than what the OS gives for the pike process.</p>
<p> Also, if you were to actually free the things, you should not
 expect the size of the pike process to drop the amount of bytes
 returned by this function. That since Pike often retains the
 memory to be reused later.</p>
<p> However, what you should expect is that if you actually free the
 things and then later allocates some more things for which this
 function returns the same size, there should be essentially no
 increase in the size of the pike process (some increase might
 occur due to internal fragmentation and memory pooling, but it
 should be small in general and over time).</p>
<p> The search for things only referenced from <code class='reference paramref'>things</code> can handle
 limited cyclic structures. That is done by doing a "lookahead",
 i.e. searching through referenced things that apparently have
 other outside references. You can control how long this lookahead
 should be through <code class='reference paramref'>options</code> (see below). If the lookahead is too
 short to cover the cycles in a structure then a too low value is
 returned. If the lookahead is made gradually longer then the
 returned value will eventually become accurate and not increase
 anymore. If the lookahead is too long then unnecessary time might
 be spent searching through things that really have external
 references.</p>
<p> Objects that are known to be part of cyclic structures are
 encouraged to have an integer constant or variable
 <code class='expr'>pike_cycle_depth</code> that specifies the lookahead needed to
 discover those cycles. When <a class='ms reference' href='../../predef_3A_3A/Pike/count_memory.html'>Pike.count_memory</a> visits such
 objects, it uses that as the lookahead when going through the
 references emanating from them. Thus, assuming objects adhere to
 this convention, you should rarely have to specify a lookahead
 higher than zero to this function.</p>
<p> Note that <code class='expr'>pike_cycle_depth</code> can also be set to zero to
 effectively stop the lookahead from continuing through the object.
 That can be useful to put in objects you know have global
 references, to speed up the traversal.</p>
</dd>
<dt class='head--doc'><span id='p-options'></span>Parameter <code class='parameter'>options</code></dt>
<dd></dd><dd class='body--doc'><p>If this is an integer, it specifies the maximum lookahead
   distance. -1 counts only the memory of the given <code class='reference paramref'>things</code>,
   without following any references. 0 extends the count to all
   their referenced things as long as there are no cycles (except
   if <code class='expr'>pike_cycle_depth</code> is found in objects - see above). 1
   makes it cover cycles of length 1 (e.g. a thing points to
   itself), 2 handles cycles of length 2 (e.g. where two things
   point at each other), and so on.</p>
<p>   However, the lookahead is by default blocked by programs, i.e.
   it never follows references emanating from programs. That since
   programs seldom are part of dynamic data structures, and they
   also typically contain numerous references to global data which
   would add a lot of work to the lookahead search.</p>
<p>   To control the search in more detail, <code class='reference paramref'>options</code> can be a
   mapping instead:</p>
<table class='box'><tr><td><code><code class='key'>lookahead</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>The maximum lookahead distance, as described above. Defaults
       to 0 if missing.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>block_arrays</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td rowspan='5'><p>When any of these are given with a nonzero value, the
       corresponding type is blocked when lookahead references are
       followed. They are unblocked if the flag is given with a
       zero value. Only programs are blocked by default.</p>
<p>       These blocks are only active during the lookahead, so
       blocked things are still recursed and memory counted if they
       are given as arguments or only got internal references.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>block_mappings</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td></tr>

<tr><td><code><code class='key'>block_strings</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>If positive then strings are always excluded (except any
       given directly in <code class='reference paramref'>things</code>), if negative they are always
       included. Otherwise they are counted if they have no other
       refs, but note that since strings are shared they might get
       refs from other unrelated parts of the program.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>block_pike_cycle_depth</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Do not heed <code class='expr'>pike_cycle_depth</code> values found in
       objects. This is implicit if the lookahead is negative.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>return_count</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Return the number of things that memory was counted for,
       instead of the byte count. (This is the same number
       <code class='expr'>internal</code> contains if <code class='expr'>collect_stats</code> is set.)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>collect_internals</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>If this is nonzero then its value is replaced with an array
       that contains the things that memory was counted for.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>collect_externals</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>If set then the value is replaced with an array containing
       the things that were visited but turned out to have external
       references (within the limited lookahead).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>collect_direct_externals</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>If set then the value is replaced with an array containing
       the things found during the lookahead that (appears to) have
       direct external references. This list is a subset of the
       <code class='expr'>collect_externals</code> list. It is useful if you get
       unexpected global references to your data structure which
       you want to track down.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>collect_stats</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>If this is nonzero then the mapping is extended with more
       elements containing statistics from the search; see below.</p>
</td></tr>
</table><p>When the <code class='expr'>collect_stats</code> flag is set, the mapping is
   extended with these elements:</p>
<table class='box'><tr><td><code><code class='key'>internal</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Number of things that were marked internal and hence memory
       counted. It includes the things given as arguments.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>cyclic</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Number of things that were marked internal only after
       resolving cycles.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>external</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Number of things that were visited through the lookahead but
       were found to be external.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>visits</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Number of times things were visited in total. This figure
       includes visits to various internal things that aren't
       visible from the pike level, so it might be larger than what
       is apparently motivated by the numbers above.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>revisits</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Number of times the same things were revisited. This can
       occur in the lookahead when a thing is encountered through a
       shorter path than the one it first got visited through. It
       also occurs in resolved cycles. Like <code class='expr'>visits</code>, this
       count can include things that aren't visible from pike.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>rounds</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>Number of search rounds. This is usually 1 or 2. More rounds
       are necessary only when blocked types turn out to be
       (acyclic) internal, so that they need to be counted and
       recursed anyway.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>work_queue_alloc</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>The number of elements that were allocated to store the work
       queue which is used to keep track of the things to visit
       during the lookahead. This is usually bigger than the
       maximum number of things the queue actually held.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><code class='key'>size</code> : <code class='datatype'>int</code></code></td><td><p>The memory occupied by the internal things. This is the same
       as the normal return value, but it's put here too for
       convenience.</p>
